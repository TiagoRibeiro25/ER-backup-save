### Elden Ring Automatic Backup Save

Playing Souls games on PC while being online, can sometimes be a pain. Me and many people have experienced cheaters ruining their save file, preventing them from enjoying the game. To combat this, I have created this script to automatically backup your save file while you play Elden Ring.

### Installation

Extract "ER-Auto Backup Save.exe" and "settings.ini" to any folder of your choice. Keep in mind that this script will automatically create a folder named "backup saves" in the same folder as these two files.

### Usage

In order to use this app, insert the path to your save file, the cooldown time you want between each backup in minutes (invalid inputs will be ignored and show a warning message) and the max amount of backups (after reaching that amount, the oldest backup save will be deleted and replaced with the newest one). Every time the backup event is triggered (every x minutes), a folder inside "backup saves" will be created with the Date and Time of the backup. This app must be running in order for the backups to work.
